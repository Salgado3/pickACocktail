## How It's Made:
I created this webpage utilizing a free API from https://www.thecocktaildb.com/ . It was the first time using an API last year. It was a great introduction on how APIs work and the potential they have to build bigger and better. I think I deserve a drink after completing this.

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Optimizations

I still want to revisit this project and clean up the CSS. Eventually incorporate a templating language like EJS to display multiple drinks based on the liquor submitted on the form.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned the structure of APIs and also was introduced to postman.co creating this web page.
